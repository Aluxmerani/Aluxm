What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git and GitHub are two different things. Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in the source code of a project. It is a distributed version control system, which means that each person working on a project has a local copy of the entire project on their own computer, allowing them to work independently and merge their changes with the rest of the team later. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. It allows developers to easily share and collaborate on their Git repositories, and it also provides tools for managing and reviewing code changes. In short, Git is a tool for managing and collaborating on code, and GitHub is a website for hosting and working with Git repositories.
